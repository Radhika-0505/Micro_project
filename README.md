sentimental analysis of amazon reviews
ABSTRACT :
    This study uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to propose a methodological approach to sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews.Using a sentiment analysis tool will help brands better comprehend and address customer feedback by tracking and assessing customer sentiments on social media. To classify social media posts and comments into good, negative, and neutral attitudes, the programme will employ natural language processing. Brands can improve their entire reputation, improve marketing strategies, and obtain insightful knowledge about client impressions by using this strategy.To improve analysis accuracy and standardise the language, the text data is preprocessed using techniques including tokenization, lowercasing, punctuation removal, and stopword elimination. To further improve the text, lemmatization or stemming approaches can be used.
